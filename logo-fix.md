# Logo Display Issue Fix

## Problem
The logo in the navigation bar was not displaying, only showing the alt text "Tab Icon" instead of the actual image.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a problematic `<picture>` element that was trying to load a non-existent WebP version of the logo:

```jsx
<picture>
    <source srcSet={`${logo.replace('.png', '.webp')}`} type="image/webp" />
    <img
        src={logo}
        alt="Tab Icon"
        loading="lazy"
        decoding="async"
        width="32"
        height="32"
    />
</picture>
```

The browser was attempting to load `logo512.webp` which doesn't exist in the assets folder, causing the image to fail to render.

## Solution Applied

### 1. CSS Size Fix
Updated the CSS to match the HTML attributes:
```css
.tabs img {
  width: 32px;  /* Changed from 24px */
  height: 32px; /* Changed from 24px */
  object-fit: contain;
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 12px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.6));
  transition: all var(--transition-slow);
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2), transparent);
  padding: 2px;
  display: block; /* Added for better rendering */
}
```

### 2. HTML Structure Fix
Removed the problematic `<picture>` element and simplified to use just the `<img>` tag:
```jsx
<img
    src={logo}
    alt="Tab Icon"
    loading="lazy"
    decoding="async"
    width="32"
    height="32"
/>
```

## Files Modified
- `src/TabSystem.js`: Removed picture element, simplified to img tag
- `src/TabSystem.css`: Updated logo dimensions from 24px to 32px, added display: block

## Result
The logo now displays correctly in the navigation bar with the intended 32x32px size and magical hover effects.

## File Structure Verified
```
src/assets/
├── logo512.png ✓ (exists, 340KB)
└── logo512.webp ✗ (missing - was causing the issue)
```
