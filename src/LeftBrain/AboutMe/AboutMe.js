                        <p>
                            My developer journey started with a simple question: "How do apps actually work?" 
                            That curiosity led me from a Computer Science student in Chandigarh to a Mac/iOS 
                            Developer at 42 Gears Mobility Systems, where I build enterprise mobility solutions 
                            used by companies worldwide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What drives me? Solving real problems through code. When I built NotingDown, my 
                            iOS note-taking app, I wasnt just creating another productivity tool‚ÄîI was addressing 
                            the frustration of scattered thoughts and ideas that many of us face daily. The app 
                            now helps users organize their digital lives with intuitive SwiftUI interfaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At 42 Gears, I work on systems that help IT administrators manage thousands of 
                            devices remotely. Every line of Swift code I write potentially saves hours of manual 
                            work for businesses. Thats the impact that motivates me‚Äîtechnology that makes peoples 
                            work lives genuinely better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond iOS development, I create Chrome extensions that solve everyday problems and 
                            build developer tools that streamline workflows. My approach? Start with the user 
                            problem, then craft elegant technical solutions.
