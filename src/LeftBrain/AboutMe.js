            <p>
                Hello! I am Sachin Kumar, a software developer passionate about
                technology, philosophy, and literature. I am currently pursuing my
                B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Chandigarh Group of
                Colleges, Landran.
            </p>
            <p>
                My technical skills include proficiency in C/C++, Python, JavaScript,
                Node.js, and React. I also have experience with databases like SQL,
                MongoDB, and Redis. I am constantly exploring new technologies such as
                system design, machine learning, and cloud computing.

            <p>
                Apart from my technical interests, I enjoy drawing, reading literature,
                and pondering the big questions in life through philosophy.
