/* ReactJS Component - Unified Design System Styles */

/* Component inherits all styling from shared-styles.css */
/* Only component-specific customizations are defined here */

/* React theme is automatically applied via .react-theme class on container */
/* This provides: --current-theme: #61DAFB, --current-theme-light: #9EEEF9, --current-theme-dark: #21A0C4 */

/* No additional custom styles needed - unified design system handles everything */
